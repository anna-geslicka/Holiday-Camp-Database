# Holiday Camp Database
Holiday Camp Database is the result of a student project on Relational Databases/Database Systems.
This project is an example of a database for a summer camp business.

**Project overview:**
The summer camp business needs a database to facilitate organisation of holiday terms.
The company has signed contracts with several holiday resorts with different sets of rooms.
While registering, participants are choosing what type of sport acitivity they are interested in.
They also have to give information about their ilnesses and allergies, if they have any.
Counsellors may have counsellor's permit, which is necessary for taking care of younger groups.
They also specialize in certain activity, and are responsible for renting equipment.
During a single holiday term in a specific resort, there can be more than one group of participants, each with their own counsellor, divided by age.
There can be more than one term.
